\section{The Documents}

The document titled ``Computing Model for the DUNE Experiment'' is kept as entry 914 in FNAL's DocDB system.
It includes the computing model for \pd experiments \eXpname and \expname in Appendix D.

The Computing Model is formulated as a way to address the \textit{Software and Computing Requirements},
which it includes as Appendix B. The Requirements predate the Computing Model and are assumed to represent
the consensus of what DUNE wants its computing sector to be organized and operated, including
a number of policies.

More recently, a number of supporting documents have been developed such as \cite{docdb1086},\cite{docdb1212},\cite{docdb1811}
which address certain implementation issues for \pd computing.
