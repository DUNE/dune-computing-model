\section{Resource Requirements}
\subsection{Overview}
The computing requirements of the DUNE experiment will evolve significantly between the time of writing
and comissioning of the full set of DUNE detector systems, for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item In short and medium term, active work will continue on DUNE prototypes, the ``35t prototype'' and protoDUNE
(see Sections~\ref{sec:35t} and \ref{sec:protodune} correspondingly).

\item Amount of R\&D work for the Near Detector is significant and it can be expected to ramp up as offline software
is being prototyped and extensive simulations will be required.

\item Investigation of optimal reconstruction methods for LArTPC is ongoing and far from complete. This means
that there will be fluctuating resource requirements (mainly CPU) for MC and reconstruction in the course of R\&D
as the algorithms are improved over the years.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prototypes}
\subsubsection{35t}
Estimates for resource requirements for the 35t prototype are given in \ref{sec:35t-resource-requirements}.
In summary, the requirements are:
\begin{itemize}

\item Raw data on disk: $\sim$200\,TB

\item Disk space to support reconstruction: $\sim$400\,TB

\item Raw data committed to permanent tape storage: $\sim$100\,TB

\item MC data on disk: $\sim$100\,TB

\item CPU for reconstruction: $\sim4\times10^6$\,hours scaled to a ``standard'' Fermigrid node. This translates into $\sim$500 Worker Nodes
committed over a period of one year in order to get the data processed during that time.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{protoDUNE/NP04}
Eastimates of protoDUNE storage requirements are fiven in \ref{sec:protodune-zs} and \ref{sec:protodune-dataprocess}.
In summary, the requirements are:
\begin{itemize}

\item Raw data on disk: $\sim$200\,TB

\item Disk space to support reconstruction: $\sim$400\,TB

\item Raw data committed to permanent tape storage: $\sim$100\,TB

\item MC data on disk: $\sim$100\,TB

\item CPU for reconstruction: $\sim4\times10^6$\,hours scaled to a ``standard'' Fermigrid node. This translates into $\sim$500 Worker Nodes
committed over a period of one year in order to get the data processed during that time.

\end{itemize}
