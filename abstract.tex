\begin{abstract}
The DUNE Offline Computing Model is described.  While the main emphasis is
on the operations phase of the full DUNE experiment, where data are collected
from both a Near Detector located at Fermilab and a liquid argon TPC far detector
located at the SURF laboratory in South Dakota, consideration is also given
to earlier computing needs for the design and prototyping phases.  Estimates
are given for the required storage, CPU, and network bandwidth needs, and descriptions
of the processing stages and analysis flow are given.  The computing infrastructure
and workflows are designed to meet the DUNE Collaboration's computing requirements,
which are described.
