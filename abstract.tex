\begin{abstract}
The DUNE Offline Computing Model is described, with  emphasis
on the operations phase of the full DUNE experiment, in which data will
be collected from both a Near Detector located at FNAL and a Liquid Argon TPC
Far Detector located at the SURF laboratory in South Dakota.
Consideration is also given
to earlier computing needs for the design and prototyping phases.  Estimates
are presented for the required storage, CPU, and network bandwidth, and descriptions
of the processing stages and analysis flow are given.  The computing infrastructure
and workflows are designed to meet the approved Computing
Requirements (policies)  of the DUNE Collaboration, which are described.
