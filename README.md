# DUNE Computing Model

## Overview
This repository contains materials of the DUNE Computing Model. The Computing Model
document serves the following needs:
* It fulfills the old mandate of LBNE for such document to be created
* It serves as a point of reference for resource and other requirements for DUNE Computing

Historically, it is continuation of the previous planning and documentation effort undertaken by LBNE,
which produced two document of interest:
* Software and Computing Plan
* The "Requirements" which were supposed to ensure agreement among the collaborators regarding policies and technology choices to be adapted.

## Drivers
* Challnges in DAQ and its interface to offline
* Scalability of computing resources
* Potential reliance on HPC for difficult reconstruction cases
